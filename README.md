Crystals Collector!


This is a numbers strategy game using javascript to generate random numbers for multiple objects and jquery to manipulate the html.

At the beginning a random number is displayed.
There are also four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

When the player clicks on any crystal, a specific number of points is added to the player's total score. The player can deduce the numeric value of each crystal by observing how many points increase in the player's total score after each crystal has been clicked.

The player wins if the total score matches the random number given at the beginning of the game.

The player loses if the score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. When the game restarts, the numeric value of each of the crystals resets randomly.
