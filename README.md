Crystals Collector!


This is a numbers strategy game.

At the beginning of the game there will be a random number displayed.

There are also four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The players can deduce the numeric value of each crystal by observing how many points increase in the player's total score after each crystal has been clicked.

The player wins if her total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if his score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. When the game restarts, the numeric value of each of the crystals resets randomly.

Enjoy!
